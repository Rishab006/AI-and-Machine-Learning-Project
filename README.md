# Machine Learning and AI Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects I've worked on in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Below is a brief overview of the techniques and models implemented:

- **Association Rules**: Discovery of relationships between variables in large datasets using association rule mining.
- **Bankruptcy Prediction**: Building predictive models to forecast the likelihood of a company going bankrupt.
- **Clustering**: Implementation of clustering algorithms to group data based on similarity.
- **Linear Regression**: Modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classification using logistic regression techniques.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Applying Monte Carlo methods for probabilistic simulations and decision-making.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Working on text data for sentiment analysis and text classification.
- **Random Forest**: Utilizing random forest algorithms for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Implementing SVM for classification and regression.
- **Wine Fraud Prediction**: Predicting fraudulent wine transactions using machine learning.

Feel free to explore the code and learn more about these techniques!
